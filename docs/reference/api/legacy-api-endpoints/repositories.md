# Repositories

These methods give access to repository management.

```{note}
For Landscape 26.04 LTS and later, these endpoints are deprecated, except for [RemoveRepositoryProfile](#removerepositoryprofile).
```

If the suite name ends with a ‘`/`’, the remote repository is flat (no dists/ structure, see https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format); in this case a single value must be passed for the ‘components’ parameter. Packages from the remote repository will be mirrored in the specified component. This parameter is optional and defaults to the same name as local series and pocket.

For example, the following request creates a pocket named ‘updates’ in the ‘natty-staging’ series of the ‘ubuntu’ distribution, with packages for ‘main’ and ‘universe’ components for ‘i386’ architecture. The pocket will be in `pull` mode from the pocket ‘updates’ of the ‘natty’ series. The latter will be typically configured to fetch packages from an ubuntu mirror:

```text
