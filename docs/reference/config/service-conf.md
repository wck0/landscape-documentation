# The `service.conf` file

All Landscape service configurations are defined in the `service.conf` file. This file follows the `INI` file format. The default location for this file is `/etc/landscape/service.conf`. You can override that by setting the `LANDSCAPE_SERVICE_CONF` environment variable with the file path location of the `service.conf` file.

Changes to the `service.conf` file only take affect once you restart the relevant service(s). Any file paths referenced throughout this document must be readable by the `landscape` system user.

Starting with Landscape 25.10, every entry in the `service.conf` file can be overridden by a corresponding environment variable. These variables have the following general structure: `LANDSCAPE_SECTION_NAME__KEY_NAME`.

The sections below contain information about the key-value pairs that can be set in each section, the corresponding environment variable, the default value (if any), and the purpose of the entry.

```{note}
The usage of the `-` character in section names and key names was deprecated in Landscape Server 25.10 in favor of the `_` character. Support for the `-` character is expected to be removed in Landscape Server 26.10.

In addition, the names of some sections of the `service.conf` file were deprecated in Landscape Server 25.10. These sections and their new names are detailed below. Support for the deprecated names is expected to be removed in Landscape Server 26.10.

Upgrades to Landscape Server 25.10 or later will include migrating these names.
```

(shared-service-settings)=
