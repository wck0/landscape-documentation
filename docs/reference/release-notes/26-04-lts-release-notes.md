You can now access Landscape 26.04 LTS in our 26.04 LTS PPA: `ppa:landscape/self-hosted-26.04`.

- Landscape Server 26.04 LTS runs on Ubuntu 26.04 LTS Resolute Raccoon, 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat, or 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish. The Landscape Server Quickstart package only runs on 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat and 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish.
- Database schema changes are required to upgrade to Landscape Server 26.04 LTS.

## Highlights

- **Repository management improvements**:

  - Introduces the new `debarchive` service for repository management.
  - Repository profiles have been updated with improved workflows.
  - The legacy API endpoints for repository management have been removed; the new archive management system replaces them.

- **Security event logging**: Security-relevant actions are now recorded in the {ref}`reference-logs`, including:

  - Authentication success and failure events
  - Password reset events
  - JWT issuance, validation, and expiry events
  - User, employee, and admin profile updates
  - Role and permission changes
  - Authorization failures

- **FDE recovery key management**: The server now provides Full Disk Encryption (FDE) recovery key management, enabling automated storage and retrieval of recovery keys for enrolled machines. A new client plugin (`fde-recovery-key-manager`) enables the client to securely report FDE recovery keys to the server.

## Breaking changes

- **Legacy API repository management endpoints removed**: Users relying on these endpoints will need to migrate to the new repository management API. See [Upgrades](#upgrades) for more details.

- **Secrets management**: The legacy v1 secrets functionality and secrets UI have been removed. The modern secrets service replaces them.

- **REST API strict content-type enforcement**: HTTP `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests to the v2 REST API now require the `Content-Type: application/json` request header. Requests that omit or incorrectly set this header will receive a 415 Unsupported Media Type response.

## Additional updates

- **TLS support for RabbitMQ**: Standard TLS connections are now supported for RabbitMQ.

- **Landscape Client - Configurable `apt update` timeout**: A new configuration option allows administrators to set a custom timeout for `apt update` operations, addressing issues with slow or unreliable package mirrors.

- **Manage release upgrades**: You can now trigger release upgrades at scale from the web portal.

- **Soft deletion of computers**: Computer records are cleaned up asynchronously, allowing for higher deletion throughput and fixing the timeout errors that some users experience when deleting old computers. Enable soft deletion by setting `computer_soft_deletion = true` under `[features]` in the `service.conf` file

- **Python version and dependency updates**:

  - Landscape Server now vendors its Python dependencies into a virtual environment and requires Python 3.12.
  - Dependencies on `netaddr`, `python3-bs4`, `python3-oops-amqp`, `python3-stripe`, `simplejson`, and `wkhtmltopdf` have been removed.
  - The build system has migrated from `setup.py/requirements.txt` to `pyproject.toml` with `uv`.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed package changer not honoring the configured proxy when downloading packages.
- Fixed WSL profiles incorrectly adding non-Windows computers.
- Fixed Landscape Client snap builds and installation issues.
- Fixed socket leak when connectors encountered errors.
- Fixed `--url` and related options in the snap to be consistent with `landscape-config`.
- Fixed an issue where the Ubuntu release upgrader log used incorrect string formatting.
- Fixed a memory leak in the `pingserver` service.
- REST API requests authenticated with a JWT belonging to a disabled account now return HTTP 403 instead of a generic error.

## Security fixes

Multiple security fixes are included in this release:

- Fixed user enumeration on the password reset page.
- Fixed a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the activity result page.
- Fixed a stored XSS vulnerability in the profile creation page.
- Fixed HTML escaping in Legacy UI page templates.
- Fixed sanitization of access group titles and descriptions (both in the UI and Legacy API).
- Fixed an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in the package upload handler.
- Fixed a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vector via GET-based state-modifying requests.
- Fixed a JavaScript execution (XSS) vulnerability.
- Replaced `xml.etree` with `defusedxml` throughout the codebase.
- Fixed a Landscape Client issue where data file permissions were too permissive.
- Fixed content-type header validation for REST API endpoints.

## Upgrades

See our 26.04 upgrade guide for detailed steps: {ref}`how-to-upgrade-to-26-04-lts`

If you use repository management in Landscape, we recommend waiting to upgrade until the 26.04.1 point release (expected August 2026). There's currently a safeguard in place to block automatic upgrades to 26.04 LTS for repository management users.

Landscape Server 26.04 LTS requires the `landscape-outbox` snap.

The updated Landscape Server Charm will not be released until the Landscape Server 26.04.1 LTS point release in August 2026.
