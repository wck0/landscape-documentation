- **Snap management**: Manage snaps directly from the Landscape web portal.

- **Landscape Client - new features for Ubuntu Core users**: The Landscape Client snap now includes additional features for Ubuntu Core users, such as remote script execution for snaps, user management on Core, and more. For more information, see the {ref}`how-to-guides-iot-for-devices-index`.
