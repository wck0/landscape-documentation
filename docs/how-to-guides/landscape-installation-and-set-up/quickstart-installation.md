# How to install Landscape Server with quickstart mode

The quickstart mode of deploying Landscape consists of installing all the necessary software on a single machine. Quickstart mode has limited scalability, so it may not be ideal for large production deployments.

Note that Quickstart installations and upgrades to Landscape 26.04 LTS are not supported on Ubuntu 26.04. You must use Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS for Quickstart installations.

If you're new to Landscape and want to learn how it works first, see the {ref}`getting-started-with-landscape` tutorial, which creates a test environment.

## Check minimum requirements

The following minimum requirements are needed to install Landscape Server 24.04 LTS or 26.04 LTS:

- **Operating system**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) or Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)
- **Hardware**: A dual-core 2 GHz processor, 8 GB of RAM, and 20 GB of disk space
- **Networking**: An IP address and FQDN with TCP communication allowed for SSH (typically port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443)
- If you plan to use Lets Encrypt to obtain an SSL certificate, DNS administration access for the hostname you’ll use to access Landscape

## Install Landscape Server

### Install prerequisites

To install prerequisites, run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ca-certificates software-properties-common
```

The `add-apt-repository` command line utility is necessary to add the PPA which contains the Landscape Server software. The `software-properties-common` package must be added to access `add-apt-repository`.

### Set environment variables

To set the necessary environment variables, run:

```bash
HOST_NAME=<HOST_NAME>
DOMAIN=<DOMAIN_NAME>
FQDN=$HOST_NAME.$DOMAIN
```

This code block includes the following values that must be changed:

`<HOST_NAME>`: The host name you’re using for the Landscape installation

`<DOMAIN_NAME>`: The domain name you’re using for the Landscape installation

It’s important to set `HOST_NAME`, `DOMAIN` and `FQDN` correctly prior to installing Landscape Server. These variables are used by other commands later.

### Set the machine’s host name

To set the machine’s host name, run:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "$FQDN"
```

When Landscape Server is installed, it'll read the machine’s host name and use it in the Apache configuration.

If your FQDN does not resolve to a public IP, you will need to ensure it resolves on the machine that you are installing Landscape Server. To do so, you can run the following command:

```bash
echo "127.0.1.1 $FQDN" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

### Attach your Ubuntu Pro token

If you have an Ubuntu Pro subscription, attach your Pro token to the server machine. For guidance, see {ref}`how-to-attach-ubuntu-pro`.

### Install `landscape-server-quickstart`

To install `landscape-server-quickstart`:

1. Add the PPA for Landscape Server, replacing `<LANDSCAPE_PPA>` with the appropriate repository:

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository -y <LANDSCAPE_PPA>
    ```

    ```{include} /reuse/landscape-ppa-description.md
    ```

2. Update packages and dependencies in your local system:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

3. Install `landscape-server-quickstart`:

    ```bash
    sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y landscape-server-quickstart
    ```

   - This installation takes approximately five minutes.

### (Landscape 26.04 only) Install the task handler snap

Install the `landscape-task-handler` snap.

```bash
sudo snap install landscape-task-handler
```

Create the task handler's own database and grant the `landscape` user access to it.

```{include} /reuse/task-handler-create-database.md
```

Configure the snap to connect to the task handler database. Replace `<DB-PASSWORD>` with the `landscape` database user's password, found in the `password` key of the `[stores]` section of `/etc/landscape/service.conf`. This value may be stored as plain text or, if prefixed with `b64:`, as base64-encoded text; in the latter case, decode it (for example, `echo '<value-without-b64-prefix>' | base64 -d`) to get the plaintext password. For the main, account, and resource databases this decoding happens automatically, but it must be done manually here because the task handler's own database is not read from `service.conf`.

```bash
sudo snap set landscape-task-handler \
  landscape.database.task-handler.host=localhost \
  landscape.database.task-handler.port=5432 \
  landscape.database.task-handler.name=landscape-standalone-task-handler \
  landscape.database.task-handler.user=landscape \
  landscape.database.task-handler.password=<DB-PASSWORD> \
  landscape.database.task-handler.ssl=disable \
  landscape.task-handler.server.grpc-port=50053 \
  landscape.task-handler.server.host=localhost
```

```{seealso}
This example uses `ssl=disable` because Quickstart mode runs PostgreSQL on the same machine. If your PostgreSQL connection requires SSL, see {ref}`task-handler-ssl-tls`.
```

```{include} /reuse/task-handler-outbox-grpc-address-note.md
```

`landscape-task-handler` is configured to work automatically with an existing Landscape Server by default. Confirm that the snap service is running.

```bash
sudo snap services landscape-task-handler
```

```{include} /reuse/task-handler-services-active.md
```

To view task handler logs, run:

```bash
sudo snap logs landscape-task-handler -n 50
```

### (Landscape 26.04 only) Install the outbox snap

Install the `landscape-outbox` snap on the same machine as your Landscape Server installation.

```bash
sudo snap install landscape-outbox
sudo snap connect landscape-outbox:grpc-client-certs landscape-task-handler:grpc-client-certs
```

`landscape-outbox` is configured to work automatically with an existing Landscape Server by default. Confirm that the snap service is running.

```bash
sudo snap services landscape-outbox
```

The output should show the `outbox` service as **active**:

```bash
Service                  Startup  Current  Notes
landscape-outbox.outbox  enabled  active   -
```

To view outbox logs, run:

```bash
sudo snap logs landscape-outbox -n 50
```

### (Landscape 26.04 only) Install the Debarchive snap

The `landscape-debarchive` snap is required for repository management from Landscape 26.04 LTS onwards. Follow the instructions in the {ref}`dedicated guide <how-to-debarchive-repository-management>`.

## Install an SSL certificate

```{note}
If you have the `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` files for your SSL certificate, skip these steps and configure Apache manually. For more details, see {ref}`how to configure the web server <how-to-heading-manual-install-configure-web-server>` in the Landscape manual installation guide.
```

### Install Certbot

Certbot is a command line utility which makes acquiring and renewing SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt an easy, free, and automated process. You can install Certbot with the `snap` or `apt` package manager.

To install Certbot with `snap`:

```bash
sudo snap install certbot --classic
```

Or `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
```

### Get an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt

If your Landscape instance has a public IP, and your FQDN resolves to that public IP, run the following to get a valid SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt:

```bash
sudo certbot --non-interactive --apache --no-redirect --agree-tos --email <EMAIL@ADDRESS.COM> --domains $FQDN
```

Replace `<EMAIL@ADDRESS.COM>` with an email address where certificate renewal reminders can be sent.

## Create a global administrator account

At this point, visiting `https://$FQDN` prompts you to create Landscape’s first Global Administrator account. To add administrators:

1. Click **Settings**
2. Set a valid outgoing email address in the **System email address** field
3. Click **Save**

By default, the email address will be pre-filled with `noreply@HOST_NAME.DOMAIN`. You may want to change this to `noreply@DOMAIN`, or another valid email address.

## (Optional) Configure Postfix for email

You can configure Postfix to handle Landscape Server email notifications and alerts. For details, see {ref}`how-to-configure-postfix`.

## Next step: Register your clients

Your Landscape server is now ready to manage client instances. To register clients:

1. See {ref}`how-to-install-landscape-client` for instructions on installation and registration.
1. When registering clients, attach an Ubuntu Pro token to each client machine to enable Pro services. If you don't have a token, you can get a free personal Ubuntu Pro subscription at [ubuntu.com/pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro).

For more details, see {ref}`how-to-attach-ubuntu-pro` and {ref}`how-to-ubuntu-pro-enable-landscape`.
