# How to install Landscape manually

This is the production deployment recommendation for Landscape Server when Juju isn't used. At a minimum, you need two machines: the database server and application server.

For a manual installation of Landscape 24.04 LTS or 26.04 LTS:

- **Database server**: Runs Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ("jammy") or Ubuntu 24.04 ("noble"), with the versions of PostgreSQL that are in the Ubuntu archives for Jammy and Noble. Jammy uses PostgreSQL 14 and Noble uses PostgreSQL 16. Landscape 26.04 LTS also runs on Ubuntu 26.04 ("resolute"), which uses PostgreSQL 18.
- **Application server**: Runs Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ("jammy") or Ubuntu 24.04 ("noble") and hosts the Landscape services. Landscape 26.04 also runs Ubuntu 26.04 LTS ("resolute").

You'll also need {ref}`certain PostgreSQL extensions <how-to-header-install-postgresql>` to setup Landscape. If you're using a managed PostgreSQL solution, check with your provider to make sure these extensions are available.

Note that manually setting up a Landscape Server Debian package deployment is a long process with many configuration steps. 

If you want a [Juju-managed](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/), charmed deployment, you can install Landscape Server with Juju. See {ref}`how-to-juju-installation` or {ref}`how-to-juju-ha-installation`.

If you're not setting up a real, production deployment and don't require scaling to a large number of client machines, you can instead install the `landscape-server-quickstart` package. For details, visit {ref}`how-to-quickstart-installation`.

## Prepare for the installation

What you'll need:

- Ubuntu server install media for the version of Ubuntu you're using
- An Ubuntu Pro subscription for access to Landscape and other Pro services. See {ref}`how-to-attach-ubuntu-pro` for attaching tokens.
- Server X509 certificate and key, signed by a publicly known Certificate Authority, and issued for the FQDN hostname of the application server.
- Custom (internal) CAs can be used, but this process isn't documented here in depth because many parts of that process take place outside of Landscape. Administrators deploying custom CAs generally know what needs to be done, but there is some guidance throughout this document.

## Install the database server

After having installed the basic server profile of Ubuntu Server, you need to install the PostgreSQL database and configure it for use by Landscape.

(how-to-header-install-postgresql)=
### Install PostgreSQL and required libraries

Run one of the following commands to install the database software.

For an Ubuntu 22.04 ("jammy") database server:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-14-debversion postgresql-plpython3-14 postgresql-contrib
```

For an Ubuntu 24.04 ("noble") database server:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-16-debversion postgresql-plpython3-16 postgresql-contrib
```

For an Ubuntu 26.04 ("resolute") database server:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-18-debversion postgresql-plpython3-18 postgresql-contrib
```

### Create a superuser Landscape can use

Landscape needs a database superuser in order to create the lower privilege users it needs to perform routine tasks and access the data, as well as alter the database schema whenever needed:

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser --createdb --createrole --superuser --pwprompt landscape_superuser
```

You should use a strong password.

```{note}
**Warning!** Don't use an `@` symbol in the password.
```

If this database is going be shared with other services, it's recommended that another cluster is created instead for those services (or for Landscape). Refer to the PostgreSQL documentation for guidance.

### Configure PostgreSQL

Now allow the application server to access this database server. Landscape uses several users for this access, so you'll need to allow them all. Edit the `/etc/postgresql/<VERSION>/main/pg_hba.conf` file (where `<VERSION>` is the installed version of PostgreSQL for example `/etc/postgresql/12/...`) and add the following to the end:

```text
host all landscape,landscape_maintenance,landscape_superuser <IP-OF-APP> md5
```

Replace `<IP-OF-APP>` with the IP address of the application server, followed by `/32`. Alternatively, you can specify the network address using the CIDR notation. Some examples of valid values:

- `192.168.122.199/32`: the IP address of the APP server
- `192.168.122.0/24`: a network address

Now come changes to the main PostgreSQL configuration file. Edit `/etc/postgresql/<VERSION>/main/postgresql.conf` and:

- Find the `listen_addresses` parameter, which is probably commented, and change it to:

    ```ini
    listen_addresses = '*'
    ```

- Set `max_prepared_transactions` to the same value as `max_connections`. For example:

    ```ini
    max_connections = 400
    ...
    max_prepared_transactions = 400
    ```

Finally, restart the database service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

### Tune PostgreSQL

It's strongly recommended to fine tune this PostgreSQL installation according to the hardware of the server. Keeping the default settings (especially of `max_connections`) is known to be problematic. For more information, visit [PostgreSQL's guide on tuning your PostgreSQL server](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Tuning_Your_PostgreSQL_Server).

#### Landscape-specific tips for tuning PostgreSQL

The following parameters at a minimum should be touched:

- [`shared_buffers`](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS)
- [`effective_cache_size`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-CACHE-SIZE)
- [`wal_buffers`](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-BUFFERS)
- [`max_connections`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS)

A good starting value for `max_connections` is 400, even on modest hardware. As your needs grow, this number should be adjusted and re-evaluated carefully. It may be helpful to use a tuning tool like [pgtune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/).

When you adjust `max_connections`, you're likely to overrun shared memory allowed by the kernel (per process) and may need to increase the [`SHMMAX`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/kernel-resources.html#SYSVIPC) parameter.

If the tuning changed the value of `max_connections`, make sure you also change `max_prepared_transactions` to the same value.

## Install the application server

The application server will host the following Landscape services:

- application server
- message server
- ping server
- job handler
- async-frontend
- combo loader
- api server
- package upload service
- package search

Additionally, other services needed by Landscape will also be running on this machine, such as:

- `apache`
- `rabbitmq-server`

### Attach your Ubuntu Pro token

If you have an Ubuntu Pro subscription, attach your Pro token to each machine that will host Landscape Server components. For guidance, see {ref}`how-to-attach-ubuntu-pro`.

### Add the Landscape package archive

Landscape is distributed in a public PPA. You can add it to the system with these commands, replacing `<LANDSCAPE_PPA>` with the appropriate repository:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository <LANDSCAPE_PPA>
```

```{include} /reuse/landscape-ppa-description.md
```

### Install the server package

Install the server package and its dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install landscape-server rabbitmq-server apache2
```

```{note}
Landscape requires RabbitMQ 3.x. RabbitMQ 4.0 dropped support for the AMQP 0-8 protocol that Landscape depends on, so RabbitMQ 4.0 and later are not supported. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS (Resolute) ships RabbitMQ 4.x, so the Quickstart installation is not supported on Ubuntu 26.04. For a manual installation on Ubuntu 26.04, RabbitMQ must run on a separate machine with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
```

### (If needed) Install the (legacy) license file

Most Landscape 24.04 LTS and later deployments use Ubuntu Pro entitlements instead of a legacy license file. If you were given a legacy license file, copy it to `/etc/landscape/license.d`:

```bash
sudo cp license.txt /etc/landscape/license.d
```

Make sure it's readable by the `landscape` user and root.

If you don't have a legacy license file, Landscape will manage client machines with Ubuntu Pro subscriptions associated with them.

### Configure rabbitmq

```{note}
You may want to change the default timeout of 30 minutes in RabbitMQ. See {ref}`how-to-configure-rabbitmq`.
```

Run the following commands, replacing `<PASSWORD>` with a password of your choice. You'll need it for later.

```bash
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user landscape <PASSWORD>
sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost landscape
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p landscape landscape ".*" ".*" ".*"
sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost landscape-hostagent
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p landscape-hostagent landscape ".*" ".*" ".*"
```

To make RabbitMQ listen only on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1), edit the file `/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf` with the following content:

```ini
NODE_IP_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
```

Then restart RabbitMQ:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart rabbitmq-server
```

### Configure database and broker access

Make the following configuration changes to the `/etc/landscape/service.conf` file to tell Landscape how to use some other services:

Section `[stores]`:

- `host`: the IP or hostname of the database server. If not the default PostgreSQL port (`5432`), add a `:NNNN` port definition after the hostname (e.g., `10.0.1.5:3232`)
- Ensure a strong password is set for user landscape (this differs from landscape_superuser password from earlier and will be created when setup script is executed)

Section `[broker]`:

- Replace the `password` value with the password chosen above when configuring rabbitmq

Section `[schema]`:

- Change the value of `store_user` to the landscape super user you created above during the DB installation
- Add an entry for `store_password` with the password that was chosen in that same step

Section `[landscape]`:

- Add an entry for `secret-token` and set it as a random string. You can set any string you want, but it should be reasonably long. You can use `openssl` to create a random string. For example, `openssl rand -base64 128 | tr -d '\n'`. Note that Landscape Server 24.04 LTS uses percent signs % for templated configuration. If you must include a percent sign in a configuration value, it can be escaped as %% so that it is interpreted as %.

If you want the services to allow only certain interfaces, you can set `allowed_interfaces` in each of the services listed in the configuration file. These must be space-separated IP addresses or host names. For example, to only allow connections on localhost, you may have a configuration like the following:

```ini
allowed_interfaces = localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

### Run the Landscape setup script

This script will bootstrap the databases Landscape needs to work and setup the rest of the configuration:

```bash
sudo setup-landscape-server
```

```{note}
Depending on the hardware, this may take several minutes to complete.
```

### Configure Landscape services and schema upgrades

Enable the Landscape services now. Edit `/etc/default/landscape-server` and change the `RUN_ALL` line to `yes`:

```ini
RUN_ALL="yes"
```

```{note}
If more performance and availability is needed from Landscape Server, it's possible to spread out the services amongst several machines. In that case, for example, you could run message servers on one machine, application servers on another, etc.
```

The message, application, and ping services can be configured to run multiple instances. If your hardware has several cores and enough memory (4GB or more), running two or more of each will improve performance. To run multiple instances of a service, set the value in the respective `RUN_*` line to the number of instances. For example, if you want to run two message servers, set:

```ini
RUN_MSGSERVER="2"
```

```{note}
To take advantage of this multiple-instances setting, you need to configure a load balancer or proxy. See the `README.multiple-services` file in the `landscape-server` package documentation directory for an example using Apache's `proxy_loadbalancer` module.
```

In the same `/etc/default/landscape-server` file, review the `UPGRADE_SCHEMA` option. If set to `yes`, whenever the package `landscape-server` is updated, it will attempt to update the database schema too. It's a convenient setting, but consider the following before enabling it:

- Schema updates can take several minutes
- If the package is updated while the database is offline, or unreachable, the update will fail
- You should have a backup of the database before updating the package

Without this setting enabled, a package update might result in services that won't start anymore because of a needed schema change. In that case:

- Stop all the Landscape services
- Backup your database
- Update the schema on the application server:

    ```bash
    sudo setup-landscape-server
    ```

- Start all Landscape services again


(how-to-heading-manual-install-configure-web-server)=
### Configure web server

Landscape uses Apache to redirect requests to each service and provide SSL support. The usual way to do this in Ubuntu is to create a Virtual Host for Landscape.

Below is a suggested configuration file that does just that. Install it as `/etc/apache2/sites-available/landscape.conf` and change the following values:

- `@hostname@`: The FQDN of the hostname the clients (browser and machines) will use to connect to Landscape Server. This is what will be in the URL, and it needs to be resolvable via DNS. For example, `landscape.example.com`
- `@certfile@`: The full filesystem path to where the SSL certificate for this server is installed. For example, `/etc/ssl/certs/landscape_server.pem`
- `@keyfile@`: The full filesystem path to where the corresponding private key of that certificate is installed. For example, `/etc/ssl/private/landscape_server.key`

If you're using a custom certificate authority for your SSL certificate, then you **must** put the CA public certificate in the `/etc/ssl/certs/landscape_server_ca.crt` file and uncomment the `SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/landscape_server_ca.crt` line.

 Make sure the `www-data` user can read those files. Also, make sure the private key can only be read by root and the `ssl-cert` group.

Enable the following modules:

```bash
for module in rewrite proxy_http ssl headers expires proxy_http2; do sudo a2enmod $module; done
```

Unless you require it and take necessary steps to secure that endpoint, it's recommended to disable the `mod_status` module:

```bash
sudo a2dismod status
```

Disable the default site:

```bash
sudo a2dissite 000-default
```

Finally, enable the new site:

```bash
sudo a2ensite landscape.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
```

### Start Landscape services

Use `lsctl`:

```bash
sudo lsctl restart
```

### (Landscape 26.04 only) Install the outbox snap

Install the `landscape-outbox` snap on the same machine as your Landscape Server installation.

```bash
sudo snap install landscape-outbox
```

`landscape-outbox` is configured to work automatically with an existing Landscape Server by default. Confirm that the snap service is running.

```bash
sudo snap services landscape-outbox
```

The output should show the `outbox` service as **active**:

```bash
Service                  Startup  Current  Notes
landscape-outbox.outbox  enabled  active   -
```

To view outbox logs, run:

```bash
sudo snap logs landscape-outbox -n 50
```

### (Landscape 26.04 only) Install the debarchive snap

The `landscape-debarchive` snap is required for repository management from Landscape 26.04 LTS onwards. Follow the instructions in the {ref}`dedicated guide <how-to-debarchive-repository-management>`.

### Create the first user

The first user that's created in Landscape automatically becomes the administrator of the "standalone" account. To create your first user, go to `https://<SERVER_NAME>` and complete the requested information.

### Configure the first client

Install and configure Landscape Client using the dedicated guides: {ref}`how-to-install-landscape-client` and {ref}`how-to-configure-landscape-client`.

If your self-hosted Landscape server uses a self-signed or custom CA certificate, see {ref}`howto-heading-register-client-self-signed-certificate`.

### (Optional) Add an email alias

You can configure Postfix to handle Landscape Server email notifications and alerts. To ensure that important system emails get attention, you can also add an alias for Landscape on your local environment. For details, see {ref}`how-to-configure-postfix`.
