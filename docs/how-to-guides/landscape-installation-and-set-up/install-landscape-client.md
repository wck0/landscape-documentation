# How to install Landscape Client

> See also: {ref}`how-to-configure-landscape-client`

There are multiple ways to install Landscape Client. This document describes each method, including basic registration steps.

If you have an Ubuntu Pro subscription, attach the Pro token before or after installing the client. See {ref}`how-to-attach-ubuntu-pro` and {ref}`how-to-ubuntu-pro-enable-landscape`.

## Install Landscape Client from Ubuntu's `main` repository

Landscape Client is available in Ubuntu's `main` repository in all [Ubuntu releases](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle), and is published independently of the self-hosted Landscape releases. This method is suitable when performing the installation through a terminal or shell scripting. To install Landscape Client from Ubuntu's `main` repository:

1. Install the `landscape-client` package:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y landscape-client
   ```

1. Set environment variables:

   ```bash
   LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME='{LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME}'
   LANDSCAPE_FQDN='{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}'
   LANDSCAPE_COMPUTER_TITLE='{LANDSCAPE_COMPUTER_TITLE}'
   ```

   This code block includes the following values which must be changed:

   `{LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME}`: Self-hosted Landscape users should set this to `standalone`. Landscape SaaS users should specify the name of their Landscape SaaS account.

   `{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}`: Self-hosted Landscape users should set this to the FQDN used during their Landscape Server installation. Landscape SaaS users should set this to `landscape.canonical.com`.

   `{LANDSCAPE_COMPUTER_TITLE}`: The name of the computer you're installing Landscape Client on. You choose this name.

1. Configure:

   ```bash
   sudo landscape-config --silent --account-name="${LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" --computer-title="${LANDSCAPE_COMPUTER_TITLE}" --tags="" --script-users='nobody,landscape,root' --ping-url="http://${LANDSCAPE_FQDN}/ping" --url="https://${LANDSCAPE_FQDN}/message-system"
   ```

When you install Landscape Client from Ubuntu's `main` repository, you install the version of Landscape Client that's included in that version of Ubuntu. For the latest features, install Landscape Client from the PPA.

## Install Landscape Client from a PPA

To install Landscape Client from a PPA:

1. Install the prerequisites:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
   ```

1. Add the PPA, replacing `{LANDSCAPE_PPA}` with the appropriate repository:

   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository -y {LANDSCAPE_PPA}
   ```

      ```{include} /reuse/landscape-ppa-description.md
      ```

1. Install the `landscape-client` package:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y landscape-client
   ```

1. Set environment variables:

   ```bash
   LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME='{LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME}'
   LANDSCAPE_FQDN='{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}'
   LANDSCAPE_COMPUTER_TITLE='{LANDSCAPE_COMPUTER_TITLE}'
   ```

   This code block includes the following values which must be changed:

   `{LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME}`: Self-hosted Landscape users should set this to `standalone`. Landscape SaaS users should specify the name of their Landscape SaaS account.

   `{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}`: Self-hosted Landscape users should set this to the FQDN used during their Landscape Server installation. Landscape SaaS users should set this to `landscape.canonical.com`.

   `{LANDSCAPE_COMPUTER_TITLE}`: The name of the computer you're installing Landscape Client on. You choose this name.

1. Configure:

   ```bash
   sudo landscape-config --silent --account-name="${LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME}" --computer-title="${LANDSCAPE_COMPUTER_TITLE}" --tags='' --script-users='nobody,landscape,root' --ping-url="http://${LANDSCAPE_FQDN}/ping" --url="https://${LANDSCAPE_FQDN}/message-system"
   ```

## Install Landscape Client with the subordinate charm

> See also: [Landscape-client charm on Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/landscape-client)

This method is suitable when using charmed operators. To install Landscape Client with the subordinate charm:

1. Set environment variables:

   ```bash
   LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME='{LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME}'
   LANDSCAPE_FQDN='{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}'
   ```

   This code block includes the following values which must be changed:

   `{LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME}`: Self-hosted Landscape users should set this to `standalone`. Landscape SaaS users should specify the name of their Landscape SaaS account.

   `{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}`: Self-hosted Landscape users should set this to the FQDN used during their Landscape Server installation. Landscape SaaS users should set this to `landscape.canonical.com`.

1. Deploy the charm:

   ```bash
   juju deploy landscape-client --config account-name='standalone' --config tags='' --config script-users='nobody,landscape,root' --config ping-url="http://${LANDSCAPE_FQDN}/ping" --config url="https://${LANDSCAPE_FQDN}/message-system"
   ```

1. Relate the charm:

   ```bash
   juju relate landscape-client <charm-name>
   ```

For more information on the Landscape client charm, see the [Charmhub documentation](https://charmhub.io/landscape-client).

## Install Landscape Client with Cloud-init

This method is suitable if it's available during a machine's provisioning stage. To install Landscape Client with cloud-init:

1. Install `landscape-client` from a PPA:

   ```yaml
   apt:
     sources:
       trunk-testing-ppa:
         source: ppa:landscape/self-hosted-24.04
   ```

1. Configure `landscape-client`. Landscape SaaS users should omit `url` and `ping_url`:

   ```yaml
   landscape:
     client:
       account_name: "{LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME}"
       computer_title: "{LANDSCAPE_COMPUTER_TITLE}"
       url: "https://{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}/message-system"
       ping_url: "http://{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}/ping"
   ```

   This code block includes the following values which must be changed:

   `{LANDSCAPE_ACCOUNT_NAME}`: Self-hosted Landscape users should set this to `standalone`. Landscape SaaS users should specify the name of their Landscape SaaS account.

   `{LANDSCAPE_COMPUTER_TITLE}`: The name of the computer you're installing Landscape Client on. You choose this name.

   `{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}`: Self-hosted Landscape users should set this to the FQDN used during their Landscape Server installation. Landscape SaaS users should omit `url` and `ping_url`.

   For additional information, see the [cloud-init Landscape module documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/modules.html#landscape).

## Install the Landscape Client snap

```{note}
The Landscape Client snap doesn't support management of Debian packages.

You must be running a self-hosted Landscape Server version 23.10 or later to use the snap.
```

The snap is generally used for Ubuntu Core devices. You can install the Landscape Client snap from the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/landscape-client) or the command line. For more detailed instructions and information on the snap's limitations, see {ref}`how-to-install-the-client-snap`.

(howto-heading-register-client-self-signed-certificate)=
## Register a client machine on a self-hosted server with a self-signed certificate

> See also: {ref}`how-to-configure-landscape-client`

If your self-hosted Landscape server uses a self-signed certificate, you'll need to download the server certificate to the client before registration. Replace `{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}` with the FQDN or IP address of your server.

Download the server certificate:

```bash
echo -n | openssl s_client -connect {LANDSCAPE_FQDN}:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' | sudo tee /etc/landscape/server.pem
```

Then register the client:

```bash
sudo landscape-config --computer-title "My client" --account-name standalone --url https://{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}/message-system --ping-url http://{LANDSCAPE_FQDN}/ping
```

If you used a custom CA, you'll need to pass the `--ssl-public-key` parameter pointing to the CA file so that the client can recognize the issuer of the server certificate.

After registration, approve the client in the Landscape web portal to begin reporting data.
