# How to install on FIPS-compliant machines

This document provides the Landscape-specific steps needed for a FIPS-compliant Landscape deployment. The FIPS-compliant process is quite similar to the standard installation process.

## Install and configure Landscape for FIPS-compliant deployments

Use the {ref}`Quickstart <how-to-quickstart-installation>` or {ref}`Manual <how-to-manual-installation>` installation guides, with the following changes:

- **Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**
- **Run `pro enable fips-updates`, then reboot**
- **Install Landscape Server (24.04 LTS or 26.04 LTS)**
- **Use `apt` packages instead of `snap` packages**
  - Snap packages can only be used if they are installed on top of a FIPS-compliant core (e.g. `core22` from the `fips-updates/stable` channel)
- **Use external authentication instead of username/password**

If you're {ref}`configuring Postfix for emails <how-to-configure-postfix>`, add the following change:

- **After you've used Postconf to configure the `/etc/postfix/main.cf` file, add an additional step to manually set the SMTP TLS fingerprint digest**:

    ```bash
    sudo postconf -e smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest=sha256
    ```

    By default, Postfix uses MD5 hashes with the TLS for backward compatibility. In FIPS mode, the MD5 hashing function is not available. SHA-256 is a secure cryptographic hash function that can be used with FIPS.
