# How to install and configure Landscape for high-availability deployments

> See also: [Juju documentation](https://juju.is/docs/juju)

You can create a scalable, high availability (HA) deployment of Landscape Server with Juju. The result is a Juju-managed deployment of Landscape Server and the other services it depends on.

You can follow the manual bundle approach below, or use the {ref}`Landscape Scalable Terraform product module <how-to-terraform-juju-deployment>` instead: it manages the same HA architecture reproducibly, and its inputs/outputs are documented in the {ref}`module reference <reference-landscape-product-modules-landscape-scalable>`.

```{important}
This guide covers both the **26.04 deployment approach** and the older **pre-26.04 deployment approach**. The 26.04 version integrates directly with the external HAProxy charm (`2.8/stable`) using the `haproxy-route` interface, replacing the older `reverseproxy` interface. For new deployments, use the 26.04 approach. For existing deployments, see {ref}`how-to-migrate-to-26-04-charm`.

The Charmhub `landscape-scalable` bundle does not currently publish a `26.04/*` track, so 26.04 (and later) bundle deployments require a custom bundle such as the one shown in this guide.
```

## Architecture overview

### 26.04 architecture (recommended)

Starting with the 26.04 version, Landscape Server uses the following architecture:

- **Landscape Server units** for the application
- **HAProxy** charm (`2.8/stable`) for load balancing via the `haproxy-route` interface
- **PostgreSQL 14+** for the database (using the modern `database` relation, backed by the `postgresql_client` interface)
- **RabbitMQ Server** for message queuing
- **Self-signed certificates** charm (or other TLS provider) integrated with HAProxy
- **Debarchive** charm for repository mirroring, integrated with Landscape Server (`debarchive` relation) and PostgreSQL
- **Landscape Task Handler** charm for offloaded task processing, integrated with Landscape Server (`task-handler` relation), PostgreSQL (`task-db`), the TLS certificates provider, and HAProxy over the `grpc-haproxy-route`/`haproxy-route-tcp` interface

HAProxy sits in front of all Landscape Server units and routes traffic to the appropriate service endpoints.

```{include} /reuse/charm-ha-architecture-2604.md
```

### Before 26.04

The older approach uses:

- **External HAProxy charm** for load balancing
- **PostgreSQL 14** for the database (using the legacy `pgsql` interface)
- **RabbitMQ Server** for message queuing
- **Separate HAProxy units** for traffic management

```{include} /reuse/charm-ha-architecture-pre-2604.md
```

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy Landscape with Juju, you need to:

  1. [Install the Juju CLI client](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/howto/manage-juju/)
  1. [Have a Juju controller bootstrapped](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/howto/manage-controllers/)
  1. Attach your Ubuntu Pro token to each machine that will host Landscape Server components. For guidance, see {ref}`how-to-attach-ubuntu-pro`.

These steps prepare your environment to deploy [machine charms](https://canonical.com/juju/charms-architecture) with Juju and [integrate them using relations](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/howto/manage-relations/).

```{note}
For improved database performance and scalability in high-load deployments, consider using PgBouncer as a connection pooler between Landscape Server and PostgreSQL. PgBouncer integrates via the Landscape Server charm's `database` relation endpoint, which uses the underlying `postgresql_client` interface. This requires recent Landscape Server charm revisions with `postgresql_client` support. See {ref}`explanation-pgbouncer-integration` for more information.
```

## Deployment approach selection

Choose the appropriate deployment approach based on your needs:

- **For new deployments:** Use the 26.04 approach (recommended)
- **For existing deployments:** Continue with the older approach or migrate using {ref}`how-to-migrate-to-26-04-charm`

---

## 26.04 deployment (recommended)

This section covers deploying Landscape Server with the external HAProxy charm introduced in version 26.04.

### Create a Juju model

```bash
juju add-model landscape-ha
```

### Deploy with a custom bundle file

For the 26.04 deployment, you'll create a custom bundle file that includes all the necessary components.

#### Step 1: Create the bundle file

Create a file named `landscape-ha-26.04.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
description: Landscape Scalable
applications:
  postgresql:
    channel: 16/stable
    charm: ch:postgresql

  - [landscape-server:inbound-amqp, rabbitmq-server]
  - [landscape-server:outbound-amqp, rabbitmq-server]

  - [landscape-server:package-upload-haproxy-route, haproxy:haproxy-route]
  - [landscape-server:repository-haproxy-route, haproxy:haproxy-route]
  - [landscape-debarchive:database, postgresql:database]
  - [landscape-debarchive:debarchive-haproxy-route, haproxy:haproxy-route]
  - [landscape-server:debarchive, landscape-debarchive:landscape-server]

  - [landscape-task-handler:certificates, self-signed-certificates:certificates]
  - [landscape-task-handler:grpc-haproxy-route, haproxy:haproxy-route-tcp]
```

```{note}
This example bundle uses PostgreSQL 16 (PostgreSQL 14+ also works) over the `database` relation, backed by the `postgresql_client` interface. Adjust the `root_url` option to match your domain name, see {ref}`Step 5: Access Landscape <how-to-header-access-landscape>` below for why setting a real hostname matters. The hostagent messenger and Ubuntu installer attach HAProxy relations are omitted here since they're optional, only add them if you enable the matching `landscape-server` config options. `landscape-debarchive` (Debarchive) provides repository mirroring and `landscape-task-handler` offloads background task processing to a dedicated unit; both are required.
```

#### Step 2: Deploy the bundle

```bash
juju deploy ./landscape-ha-26.04.yaml
```

#### Step 3: Monitor the deployment

Watch the deployment progress:

```bash
juju status --watch 3s
```

Once everything is installed and settled, the `Status` for every application will be `active`:

```text
App                       Version  Status  Scale  Charm                      Channel       Rev  
haproxy                            active      1  haproxy                    2.8/stable     485
landscape-debarchive               active      1  landscape-debarchive       latest/stable  2
landscape-server                   active      3  landscape-server           26.04/stable   485
landscape-task-handler             active      1  landscape-task-handler     latest/stable  3 
postgresql                16.11    active      3  postgresql                 16/stable      1047 
rabbitmq-server           3.12.1   active      3  rabbitmq-server            latest/edge    252
self-signed-certificates           active      1  self-signed-certificates   1/stable       22
```

#### Step 4: Configure license file

Set your Landscape license:

```sh
juju config landscape-server "license_file=$(cat your-license-file)"
```

(how-to-header-access-landscape)=
#### Step 5: Access Landscape

HAProxy routes traffic based on the `hostname` configured in the `haproxy-route` relation, not by IP address alone, so you must connect using the hostname set in `root_url` (via DNS, or `curl --resolve`/a `/etc/hosts` entry for testing) — connecting directly to the HAProxy unit's IP with no matching `Host` header returns HAProxy's default page, not Landscape. If you omit `root_url`, the `landscape-server` charm falls back to using its leader unit's IP address as the routing hostname instead, which is impractical to connect with directly; setting `root_url` to a real hostname is strongly recommended even for testing. Use `juju status` to find the HAProxy unit IP address to point that hostname at.

```{important}
This same hostname resolution requirement also applies internally: the outbox component running on the `landscape-server` units connects to the Task Handler's gRPC server through HAProxy's `grpc-haproxy-route`/`haproxy-route-tcp` passthrough, using the same hostname. If that hostname doesn't resolve on the `landscape-server` units (for example, when deploying locally without a real domain), add an `/etc/hosts` entry on those units pointing the hostname at the HAProxy unit's IP address. This dependency is one-directional: outbox (on `landscape-server`) connects to Task Handler, but Task Handler never needs to resolve or connect back to `landscape-server`.
```

### Optional: Replace self-signed certificates with a valid certificate

If you deployed the example bundle above, it includes self-signed certificates (suitable for testing). For production, replace them with a valid certificate, such as one from Let's Encrypt:

```bash
juju remove-application self-signed-certificates

juju deploy lego --channel 4/stable
juju config lego server="https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
juju config lego email="admin@example.com"
juju config lego plugin="http"

juju integrate haproxy:certificates lego:certificates
juju integrate haproxy:receive-ca-certs lego:send-ca-cert
```

**Prerequisites:**

- Domain in `root_url` must resolve to the HAProxy unit IP
- Port 80 must be accessible for ACME HTTP-01 challenge validation
- Valid email for certificate notifications

For more details, see the [lego charm documentation](https://charmhub.io/lego/docs/getting-started-with-lego-http01).

(heading-lbaas-installation)=
### Optional: External Load Balancer with Cross-Model Integration (LBaaS)

For production deployments requiring an external load balancer in a separate infrastructure layer, you can deploy HAProxy in a **separate Juju model** and connect it to Landscape Server using cross-model relations (also known as LBaaS - Load Balancer as a Service).

This approach is useful when:

- You want to manage your load balancer infrastructure separately from application deployments
- You need a dedicated load balancer shared across multiple applications
- You want to isolate load balancer lifecycle from application lifecycle

#### Step 1: Create a separate model for the load balancer

```bash
juju add-model lbaas
juju switch lbaas
```

#### Step 2: Deploy HAProxy and TLS certificates in the LBaaS model

Deploy HAProxy:

```sh
juju deploy haproxy --channel 2.8/stable
juju expose haproxy
```

Deploy the TLS certificates provider:

```sh
juju deploy lego --channel 4/stable
juju config lego server="https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
juju config lego email="admin@example.com"
juju config lego plugin="http"
```

Wait for both applications to become active:

```sh
juju wait-for application haproxy --query='status=="active"'
juju wait-for application lego --query='status=="active"'
```

Integrate HAProxy with the TLS certificates provider:

```sh
juju integrate haproxy:certificates lego:certificates
juju integrate haproxy:receive-ca-certs lego:send-ca-cert
```

#### Step 3: Create a cross-model offer

```sh
juju offer haproxy:haproxy-route,haproxy-route-tcp
```

This creates a single offer exposing both the `haproxy-route` and `haproxy-route-tcp` endpoints, which can be consumed from other Juju models. `haproxy-route-tcp` is needed for `landscape-task-handler` (required), and also if you enable the optional hostagent messenger or Ubuntu installer attach services on `landscape-server`.

#### Step 4: Consume the HAProxy offer and integrate Landscape Server

Switch back to your Landscape Server model:

```sh
juju switch landscape-ha
```

Consume the HAProxy offer from the lbaas model:

```sh
juju consume admin/lbaas.haproxy lbaas-haproxy
```

Integrate Landscape Server's route endpoints directly with the external HAProxy:

```sh
juju integrate landscape-server:appserver-haproxy-route lbaas-haproxy:haproxy-route
juju integrate landscape-server:pingserver-haproxy-route lbaas-haproxy:haproxy-route
juju integrate landscape-server:message-server-haproxy-route lbaas-haproxy:haproxy-route
juju integrate landscape-server:api-haproxy-route lbaas-haproxy:haproxy-route
juju integrate landscape-server:package-upload-haproxy-route lbaas-haproxy:haproxy-route
juju integrate landscape-server:repository-haproxy-route lbaas-haproxy:haproxy-route
```

Integrate Debarchive's `debarchive-haproxy-route` endpoint the same way, so it's reachable through the external HAProxy:

```sh
juju integrate landscape-debarchive:debarchive-haproxy-route lbaas-haproxy:haproxy-route
```

Integrate `landscape-task-handler`'s gRPC route with the `haproxy-route-tcp` endpoint of the same offer:

```sh
juju integrate landscape-task-handler:grpc-haproxy-route lbaas-haproxy:haproxy-route-tcp
```

If you enable the optional hostagent messenger or Ubuntu installer attach services on `landscape-server`, integrate their HAProxy endpoints with `lbaas-haproxy:haproxy-route-tcp` the same way, after enabling the matching charm config.

```{important}
The outbox component on the `landscape-server` units reaches Task Handler through this HAProxy route by hostname, not by IP. If that hostname doesn't resolve on the `landscape-server` units (for example, testing locally without a real domain), add an `/etc/hosts` entry there pointing it at the external HAProxy's IP address.
```

Wait for the deployment to complete:

```sh
juju wait-for application landscape-server --query='status=="active"'
```

#### Step 5: Configure DNS and access

Get the HAProxy public IP address:

```sh
juju switch lbaas
juju status haproxy --format=json | jq -r '.applications.haproxy.units | to_entries[0].value["public-address"]'
```

Configure your DNS to point your hostname (matching `root_url`) to this IP address.

Access Landscape via: `https://landscape.example.com/`

## Pre-26.04 deployment

```{warning}
This deployment approach is **deprecated**. For new deployments, use the 26.04 approach described above. For existing deployments, consider migrating using {ref}`how-to-migrate-to-26-04-charm`.
```

This section covers the older deployment approach using the external HAProxy charm. This approach is maintained for existing deployments only.

### Deploy the charm bundle

> See also: [Landscape Scalable bundle on Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/landscape-scalable)

You can deploy the Landscape Scalable charm bundle using one of two main methods. The methods are:

  1. Deploy the bundle with the default configuration, then customize the configuration
  1. Download the bundle configuration, customize it, then deploy it

This guide describes both methods.

### Option 1: Deploy with the default configuration

Once you have a Juju machine cloud configured, deploying the charm bundle with the default configuration is relatively straightforward.

#### Step 1: Create a Juju model

```bash
juju add-model landscape-self-hosted
```

#### Step 2: Deploy `landscape-scalable`

You can deploy the `landscape-scalable` charm bundle directly.

```bash
juju deploy landscape-scalable
```

It will take some time for the bundle to finish deploying. You can watch the deployment progress with `juju status`:

```bash
juju status --watch 3s
```

`--watch` refreshes the status periodically. This example is set to refresh every three seconds.

You can also check the status at any time without `--watch`:

```bash
juju status
```

At first, the `juju status` output will indicate that all units are waiting for machines to become available:

```text

3        pending           pending  ubuntu@22.04
```

Once everything is installed and settled, the `Status` for every application will be `active`:

```text

3        started  10.76.244.71   juju-dded29-3  ubuntu@22.04      Running
```

#### Step 3: Add application units

The following commands add two additional units of Landscape Server, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and HAProxy. Execute these commands to create your high availability deployment with three units of each service.

```bash
juju add-unit landscape-server -n 2
juju add-unit postgresql -n 2
juju add-unit rabbitmq-server -n 2
juju add-unit haproxy -n 2
```

The charms for each application handle relationships between the units. The unit indicated with an asterisk (`*`) in the `juju status` output is the current leader unit.

After the new units are given machines and the charm installation and setup is complete, the result is a high availability deployment:

```text
Model                  Controller           Cloud/Region         Version  SLA          Timestamp

You now have Landscape Server set up for a high-availability deployment. Next, you need to set up your clients by {ref}`installing the Landscape Client charm <how-to-install-landscape-client>` on each client, and configuring them with [the `juju config` command](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/juju-cli/list-of-juju-cli-commands/config/). You may also need to change your SSL certificate configuration. See the {ref}`how-to-header-configure-haproxy-with-ssl-cert` section in this guide for more information.

### Option 2: Customize the configuration before deployment

If you would rather do all of your configuration up-front and then let Juju orchestrate everything during deployment, you can download the charm bundle's YAML file and customize it.

#### Step 1: Download the `landscape-scalable` charm bundle

```bash
juju download landscape-scalable
```

You'll get output similar to:

```text
Fetching bundle "landscape-scalable" revision 37 using "stable" channel and base "amd64/ubuntu/22.04"
Install the "landscape-scalable" bundle with:
    juju deploy ./landscape-scalable_r37.bundle
```

Then, unzip it:

```bash
unzip ./landscape-scalable_r37.bundle
```

You'll get output similar to:

```text
Archive:  ./landscape-scalable_r37.bundle
  inflating: bundle.yaml
  inflating: README.md
  inflating: manifest.yaml
```

#### Step 2: Edit the `bundle.yaml` file

You need to increase the `num_units` for each application to turn your deployment into a high availability deployment. In this example, we set each service to `num_units: 3`. This means there will be three units of each Landscape Server, HAProxy, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ.

```yaml

relations:
    - [landscape-server, rabbitmq-server]
    - [landscape-server, haproxy]
    - [landscape-server:db, postgresql:db-admin]
```

#### Step 3: Deploy the `bundle.yaml` file

```bash
juju deploy ./bundle.yaml
```

It will take some time for the bundle to finish deploying, you can watch the deployment progress with `juju status`:

```bash
juju status --watch 3s
```

`--watch` refreshes the status periodically. This example is set to refresh every three seconds.

You can also check the status at any time without `--watch`:

```bash
juju status
```

At first, the `juju status` output will indicate that all units are waiting for machines to become available:

You now have Landscape Server set up for a high-availability deployment. Next, you need to set up your clients by {ref}`installing the Landscape Client charm <how-to-install-landscape-client>` on each client, and configuring them with [the `juju config` command](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/juju-cli/list-of-juju-cli-commands/config/). You may also need to change your SSL certificate configuration. See the {ref}`how-to-header-configure-haproxy-with-ssl-cert` section in this guide for more information.

(how-to-header-configure-haproxy-with-ssl-cert)=
## Configure SSL certificates (pre-26.04 deployments only)

```{warning}
This section applies **only to pre-26.04 deployments** using the external HAProxy charm. For 26.04 deployments, see the TLS certificates configuration in the 26.04 deployment section above.
```

### For pre-26.04 deployments with external HAProxy charm

The older HAProxy charm uses self-signed SSL certificates by default. Landscape Clients and your browser won't trust this certificate.

**Option 1: Manual certificate configuration**

If you have a valid SSL certificate:

```bash
juju config haproxy ssl_cert="$(base64 fullchain.pem)" ssl_key="$(base64 privkey.pem)"
```

**Option 2: Let's Encrypt with certbot**

If your Landscape instance has a public IP and your FQDN resolves to it:

```bash
# On a machine with port 80 accessible
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d $FQDN --non-interactive --agree-tos --email admin@example.com
```

This produces `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` files:

```bash
juju config haproxy ssl_cert="$(base64 /etc/letsencrypt/live/$FQDN/fullchain.pem)" \
  ssl_key="$(base64 /etc/letsencrypt/live/$FQDN/privkey.pem)"
```

```{note}
Certificate renewal must be handled manually for pre-26.04 deployments. Consider migrating to 26.04 for automatic certificate management via the `tls-certificates` interface.
```
