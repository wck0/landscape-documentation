# How to manage and mirror repositories with the API

> See also: {ref}`explanation-repo-mirroring`

```{note}
This document applies to **Landscape 25.10 and earlier**. See the {ref}`reference-release-notes-26-04-lts` for details on our changes to repository management in 26.04.

Repository mirroring is available for self-hosted users.
```

Repository management requires the use of the Landscape {ref}`API <how-to-use-legacy-api>` Set it up and have it ready for the next steps. Linux distributions like Ubuntu use repositories to hold packages you can install on managed computers. While Ubuntu has several repositories that anyone can access, you can also maintain your own repositories on your network, and enforce repository configurations for the machines you manage. This can be useful when you want to maintain packages with different versions from those in the community repositories, or if you have private repositories of in-house software for internal distribution. Once you add your machines to a Landscape repository profile, you have a choice to enforce the entire repository configuration, or just individual repositories.

In the following instructions we will use:

- **Distribution**: ubuntu
- **Series**: bionic
- **Pocket**: release, updates, security
- **Components**: main, restricted, universe, multiverse
- **{ref}`reference-terms-tags`**: example-tag
- **repository profile**: example-profile
- **mirror-key**: the name of the gpg key used by Landscape to sign your repository

Make sure you have set up the {ref}`API <how-to-use-legacy-api>` client already, then follow the steps below. The following instructions were performed on a Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Landscape server 19.01 installed.

> ⓘ Note: The special pocket release never gets mentioned in a suite.

In a `sources.list` line, you would see:

```bash
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/DISTRIBUTION/ SERIES-POCKET COMPONENT [COMPONENT ...]
```

## Disk space requirements

```{include} /reuse/repository-disk-space.md
```

## Create the gpg key

Create a secret GPG key and import it into Landscape. This will be used by self-hosted Landscape to sign your repository. For this guide, we'll create a key with the 'real name' of `Mirror Key`.

First step is to install and run rngd to speed-up the creation of the gpg key.

```bash
sudo apt-get install rng-tools && sudo rngd -r /dev/urandom
```

Then, create the key that will be used to sign your repository. You can use either of the following commands, but `--gen-key` creates a GPG key that sets a two year expiration date, and `--full-gen-key` creates a GPG key that does not expire.

```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

```bash
gpg --full-gen-key
```

```{note}
**FIPS users:** If your Landscape server is Ubuntu 24.04 or newer with FIPS enabled, you must use the `--full-gen-key` option, select RSA for the key type, and use 4096 bits. The default key type for the `gpg` command has been updated to ed25519, but this isn't currently approved for FIPS. Only RSA keys are approved for FIPS.
```

You will be prompted twice for:

```text
Please enter the passphrase to protect your new key
Do not set any password. Choose `<OK>` to continue.
```

Next, at `"Please confirm that you do not want to have any protection on your key"` choose:

```text
<Yes, protection is not needed>
```

Note: the secret key must NOT have a passphrase. To remove the passphrase from a key, before exporting it, use:

```bash
gpg --edit-key A1234B5678C9101112D12141516E17181920FGH0
```

List the keys:

```bash
gpg -K sec rsa3072 2019-02-05 [SC] [expires: 2021-02-04] A1234B5678C9101112D12141516E17181920FGH0 uid [ultimate] Mirror Key ssb rsa3072 2019-02-05 [E] [expires: 2021-02-04]
```

Copy the new key's numeric ID and export the key to a file:

```bash
gpg -a --export-secret-keys A1234B5678C9101112D12141516E17181920FGH0 > mirror-key.asc
```

Import the key file to Landscape:

```bash
landscape-api import-gpg-key mirror-key mirror-key.asc --json

{
    'fingerprint': 'e144:5a89:bc8d:4fbc:49bc:5947:5eb9:93be:549a:8d7a',
    'has_secret': true,
    'id': 1,
    'key_id': '1BE771BB147D6E6D',
    'name': 'mirror-key'
}
```

## Create the distribution, series and pockets

Create the distribution first:

```bash
landscape-api create-distribution ubuntu
```

Create the series and the pockets which are what hold the actual packages. This will create a `bionic` series, with pockets for `release`, `security` and `updates`. For components, we select `main`, `restricted`, `universe` and `multiverse`. It won't download any packages yet, just create the logical infrastructure for them.

```bash
landscape-api create-series bionic ubuntu \
 --pockets release,updates,security \
 --components main,restricted,universe,multiverse \
 --architectures amd64,i386 \
 --gpg-key mirror-key \
 --mirror-uri http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ \
 --mirror-series bionic
```

## Sync pockets

```{note}
If you're running Landscape on Jammy 22.04 or later, you may need to change the default timeout of 30 minutes in RabbitMQ for your pockets to sync successfully. For more information, see {ref}`how-to-configure-rabbitmq`.
```

We can sync only one pocket at a time. Once one pocket sync is done, we can start the next one. This command will start the actual mirroring process for the `release` pocket:

```bash
landscape-api sync-mirror-pocket release bionic ubuntu --json

{
    'children': [],
    'computer_id': null,
    'creation_time': '2023-10-14T19:45:51Z',
    'creator': {
        'email': 'stan@example.com',
        'id': 1,
        'name': 'Stan Peters'
    },
    'id': 101,
    'parent_id': null,
    (...)
```

This will create an activity called `"Sync pocket 'release' of series 'bionic' in distribution 'ubuntu'"` that will be visible at `https://your-server.com/account/standalone/activities`.

Depending on your connection speed to the archive, the above may take a few hours. The output of the sync activity you just initiated will show an `id`. To monitor its progress, you can run a query on the activity `id` plus one. If the `id` in the output was `101`, we'll query for `102` and inspect the `progress` percent result, which in this example is 75.

```bash
landscape-api get-activities --json --query id:102 (...)

[
    {
        'id': 102,
        'parent_id': null,
        'pocket_id': 5,
        'pocket_name': 'release',
        'progress': 75,
        (...)
```

It's almost done. Once it's finished the `'progress'` will be 100 and the activity `Status` in the WebUI will show `Succeeded`. Now, we can issue another call, this time to sync the `updates` pocket. As soon as this one is completed, we can finally sync the `security` pocket.

```bash
landscape-api sync-mirror-pocket updates bionic ubuntu
landscape-api sync-mirror-pocket security bionic ubuntu
```

The repositories are also visible via a web browser at:

`http://your-server.com/repository/standalone/ubuntu/pool/`

and

`http://your-server.com/repository/standalone/ubuntu/dists/`

## Create a repository profile

We will create a repository profile named `example-profile` that later will be associated with a tag named `example-tag`. This profile will be applied to all computers that have that tag.

```bash
landscape-api create-repository-profile \
 --description "This profile is for self-hosted Landscape servers." example-profile \
 --json

{
    'all_computers': false,
    'description': 'This profile is for self-hosted Landscape servers.',
    'id': 5,
    'name': 'example-profile',
    'pockets': [],
    'tags': []
}
```

## Associate computers with repository profile

This will associate all the computers with the tag `example-tag` to the `example-profile` repository profile:

```bash
landscape-api associate-repository-profile \
 --tags example-tag example-profile \
 --json

{
    'all_computers': false,
    'description': 'This-profile-is-for-self-hosted-Landscape-servers.',
    'id': 5,
    'name': 'example-profile',
    'pockets': [],
    'tags': [
        'example-tag'
    ]
}
```

## Add pockets to the repository profile

```bash
landscape-api add-pockets-to-repository-profile example-profile release,updates,security bionic ubuntu
```

At the end of this activity, all computers that have the `example-tag` will get an entry in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` pointing to the newly created repository for Bionic. This will create the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/landscape-example-profile.list` sources file containing the following apt lines:

```bash
deb http://your-server.com/repository/standalone/ubuntu bionic-security main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://your-server.com/repository/standalone/ubuntu bionic main restricted universe multiverse
deb http://your-server.com/repository/standalone/ubuntu bionic-updates main restricted universe multiverse
```

Landscape will take over the client's apt sources. The original `sources.list` file will be moved aside and only the ones enabled in Landscape will work.

```bash
cat /etc/apt/sources.list # Landscape manages repositories for this computer # Original content of sources.list can be found in sources.list.save
```

To revert the changes, disassociate the tag from the repository profile:

```bash
landscape-api disassociate-repository-profile --tags example-tag example-profile
```

## Edit pockets

If needed, pockets can be modified using `edit-pocket`. For example, to change the archive mirror address:

```bash
landscape-api edit-pocket release bionic ubuntu \
 --mirror-uri https://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/ubuntu/ \
 --mirror-suite bionic
```

This will change the `mirror_uri` for the `release` pocket of the `bionic` series in the `ubuntu` distribution from:

`http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/`

to:

`https://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/ubuntu/`

Using an `https` source could be useful in situation where a content filtering interferes with the pocket sync when using an `http` source. Some of the [Official Archive Mirrors for Ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors) are available over `https` although they are not advertised in the mirror list. For more options have a look at `landscape-api edit-pocket --help`.

## Upload pockets

Removing a package from a pocket is only supported in upload mode. Landscape lets you create and manage repositories that hold packages uploaded by authorized users. You could, for example, create a staging area to which certain users could upload packages. Here is a quick how-to for creating and uploading packages to such a repository.

Create another gpg key with no passphrase and the "real name" of `Upload Key`. Export the key from gpg and import it to Landscape.

```bash
gpg -a --export-secret-keys $KEYID > upload-key.asc
landscape-api import-gpg-key upload-key upload-key.asc
landscape-api get-gpg-keys
```

If the above was successful, you will have two gpg keys in Landscape.

Assuming this pocket is for bionic and that the ubuntu distribution is created already, this command will create the upload type pocket:

```bash
landscape-api create-pocket staging bionic ubuntu main amd64 upload upload-key
```

where:

- **staging**: the name of our upload pocket
- **ubuntu**: the distribution (`create-distribution ubuntu`)
- **bionic**: the series (`create-series bionic ubuntu`)
- **main**: the component
- **amd64**: the architecture
- **upload**: the pocket type
- **upload-key**: a private passphrase-less GPG key

Such a repository will be accessible via this sources.list entry:

```bash
deb http://your-server.com/repository/standalone/ubuntu bionic-staging main
```

You can choose who is allowed to upload packages to this pocket. Since the option `--upload-allow-unsigned` was not used when creating the pocket, only uploads signed by any of the `uploader gpg keys` will be allowed. Unsigned uploads, or signed by a key not in that list, will be rejected. To add or remove a key from that list, use `add-uploader-gpg-keys-to-pocket` and `remove-uploader-gpg-keys-from-pocket` respectively.

To upload packages to this pocket we use the tool `dput` with this configuration section in `~/.dput.cf`:

```ini
[lds]
fqdn = your-server.com
method = https
incoming = /upload/standalone/%(lds)s
```

The `%(lds)s` bit will be replaced by whatever follows the `lds:` prefix in the dput command shown below. The package debian/changelog file must contain the `bionic-staging` target, like this example:

```text
my-package (1.0-0ubuntu1) bionic-staging; urgency=low

 * Released 1.0

-- Package Builder <builder@example.com> Tue, 12 Feb 2023 14:57:05 -0300 (...)
```

Since Landscape doesn't build packages from source, you will have to build the package locally for the right architecture and then upload the binary changes file, like this:

```bash
dput lds:ubuntu/bionic/staging my-package_1.0-0ubuntu1_amd64.changes
```

> ⓘ Note the path components: `lds:distro/series/pocket`.

If there are errors, they will be logged in the server's `/var/log/landscape/package-upload-1.log` log file. An email will also be sent to the uploader detailing the error.

For example, let's say you forgot to add the public GPG key of a developer to this pocket. If he tries to upload a package, he will get an error like this back in an email:

```text
Subject: Package import failed for 'storm_0.18.1-0landscape4_amd64.changes' The following error(s) occurred in package import: * Uploaded data is not signed, but the destination pocket requires it * The signature on following file(s) could not be verified. Please make sure to import the GPG key(s) used to sign the files or use a different key to sign them. - storm_0.18.1-0landscape4_amd64.changes (key id 784259B3F3DDC290)
```

To fix this, we authorize uploads signed by that GPG key. Exported to a file:

```bash
gpg -a --export-secret-key 784259B3F3DDC290 > 784259B3F3DDC290.pem
```

Import it into Landscape:

```bash
landscape-api import-gpg-key key-f3ddc290 ./784259B3F3DDC290.pem --json

{
    'fingerprint': '6f96:333f:ae2c:0ce5:254a:8742:7842:59b3:f3dd:c290',
    'has_secret': true,
    'id': 7,
    'name': 'key-f3ddc290'
}
```

Authorize it:

```bash
landscape-api add-uploader-gpg-keys-to-pocket staging bionic ubuntu key-f3ddc290 --json (...)

{
    'upload_allow_unsigned': false,
    'upload_gpg_keys': [
        {
            'fingerprint': '6f96:333f:ae2c:0ce5:254a:8742:7842:59b3:f3dd:c290',
            'has_secret': True,
            'id': 7,
            'name': 'key-f3ddc290'
        }
    ]
}
```

If you don't want to use gpg keys, change the pocket to allow unsigned packages:

```bash
landscape-api edit-pocket staging bionic ubuntu --upload-allow-unsigned=true
```

## Pull pockets

Pull mode pockets are meant to "stage" packages coming from another pocket, for example if you want to exclude some packages from that pocket, you can use filters (blocklist/allowlist) and then pull packages in the pocket again. Note that since pull operations don't really fetch packages, but just builds repository indices, you can also remove and recreate pull pockets very quickly if you want to start from scratch with filters. When creating the pull type pocket, you have to specify if you want a allowlist or blocklist for filtering.

```bash
landscape-api create-pocket \
 release-staging bionic ubuntu \
 main,universe amd64 mirror mirror-sign-key \
 --pull-pocket release \
 --filter-type=whitelist
```

The blocklist only works only for pull type repositories, but those don't support syncing from upstream archives, only from local ones.

## Repository management mirroring tips

Here are some simple tips on how to create standard repositories using Landscape. They all use the `create-pocket` API call, so to use them, you must have created a distribution (for example ubuntu, using a command like `create-distribution ubuntu`) and a series (for instance bionic, with a command like `create-series bionic ubuntu`). For complete create-pocket syntax, run the command `landscape-api create-pocket -h`. Suppose you want to mirror an upstream repository. Basic usage looks like this:

```bash
landscape-api create-pocket \
 <POCKETNAME> <SERIES> <DISTRIBUTION> \
 <COMPONENT> <ARCHITECTURE> <MODE> <GPGKEY> \
 [--mirror-suite <MIRROR-SUITE>] \
 [--mirror-uri <MIRROR-URI>]
```

In this command, landscape-api and create-pocket are constants; the rest are variables. The values in [brackets] are optional.

For `MIRROR-SUITE`, use the release designation; you can add an optional suffix to the name if you want only certain packages, such as all updates or only security updates.

- **pocketname** should match the suffix of the **mirror-suite**, or if you're mirroring an entire release, use release.
- **series** is a release nickname, such as xenial or bionic.
- The **distribution** is ubuntu.
- The **component** name may be one or more components (main, restricted, universe, multiverse) separated by commas.
- The **architecture** may be amd64, i386 or armhf separated by commas.
- Pocket **mode** may be pull, mirror, or upload.
- The **gpgkey** is the private passphrase-less GPG key that you created above.

Here's an example with some values filled in:

```bash
landscape-api create-pocket \
 release bionic ubuntu \
 main,universe amd64 mirror mirror-sign-key \
 --mirror-suite bionic \
 --mirror-uri http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
```

In this command, `--mirror-suite` indicates you want to create a pocket to mirror a series (`bionic`) as it was released, without any updates. To create a pocket to mirror `updates` for a series, add the `-updates` suffix on the series name:

```bash
landscape-api create-pocket \
 updates bionic ubuntu \
 main,universe amd64 mirror mirror-sign-key \
 --mirror-suite bionic-updates \
 --mirror-uri http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
```

To create a pocket to mirror only `security` updates for a series, use the `-security` suffix:

```bash
landscape-api create-pocket \
 security bionic ubuntu \
 main,restricted,universe,multiverse amd64 mirror mirror-key \
 --mirror-suite bionic-security \
 --mirror-uri http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
```

The specific suffix is not significant. You could theoretically choose a different convention for pocket names, but we suggest you stick to this usage. Once you've created the pocket or pockets you want to use, call `sync-mirror-pocket` to start the mirroring process:

```bash
landscape-api sync-mirror-pocket release bionic ubuntu
```

## Mirror smaller pocket for testing

For testing purposes, instead of mirroring the whole `bionic` series, you can just mirror the `restricted` component of the `updates` pocket:

```bash
landscape-api create-series bionic ubuntu \
 --pockets updates \
 --components restricted \
 --architectures amd64 \
 --gpg-key mirror-key \
 --mirror-uri http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ \
 --mirror-series bionic
```
